  <img src="images/nick-botting.jpg" alt="Nick Botting" />
  <p>Nick Botting exhibits every year at the Portland Gallery in London.</p>
  <p>We think we have some of his best paintings here in Carlton. Some were painted last time he visited Australia
  and include Windy Day, Airey’s Inlet, The Dome Reading Room, State Library of Victoria and some Carlton
  views England Going Out to Bat after Lunch 1st Test, Lahore 2000.</p>
  <p>Nick Botting is a well-known English painter who loves to paint ‘en plein air’. He has been known to
  set up his easel anywhere from the middle of an intersection to the roof of a car and once carried a full
  length mirror out into the Australian desert to paint a self-portrait! His paintings are concerned with capturing
  small moments in time and preserving them, and the people in them, for the viewer’s voyeuristic
  pleasure.</p>
